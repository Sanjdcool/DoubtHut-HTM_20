# TRACK : Education

In this difficult time of COVID-19 outspread students are not able to attend their schools or tuitions. So, they are not able to meet their classmates and hence unable to discuss their academic doubts what they earlier used to do if free lectures or after classes as after all your friend can sometime explain better than a teacher. Therefore, this Project "DoubtHut" is made to solve this problem. This web app is a portal where a student can ask questions and other students can answer his/her question and vice-versa. Also the students can post articles and read other students' articles and bookmark answers of others'. Each student has its own dashboard that includes his/her questions raised, answered questions, articles posted and bookmarks added. Also to reduce spamming google OAuth i.e Sign in with google has been added to it. Using this web app they can stay in their homes and connect and help each other in their academic doubts. This app is fully responsive and works on both big screens and mobile phones perfectly.
